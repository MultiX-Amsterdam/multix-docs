(Last updated: Apr 8, 2025)

This document is created by Yen-Chia Hsu when running the data science and information visualization courses for the Bachelor Information Science program (Informatiekunde), based on personal experiences and also the university's [documentation of teaching matters](https://datanose.nl/#docentensite).

**Important: this document is created in the context of the Informatics Institute under the Bachelor Information Science program (Informatiekunde). The situation may be different if you teach in another faculty or in another program.**
